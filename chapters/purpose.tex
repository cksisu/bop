I am studying the BOOK OF PROOF as preparation for the mathematical portion of
Machine Learning studies that I have based on the Carnegie Mellon Machine
Learning masters program. Specifically, this is part of my effort to prepare
for studying materials covered in the '36-700 Probability \& Mathematical
Statistics or 36-705 Intermediate Statistics' course requirement.

After completing this survey in forming mathematical proofs, I will begin
studying probability, mathematical stattistics and calculus as they comprise
the bulk of the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning.
